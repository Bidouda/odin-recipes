    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Cowboy Steak is a hearty bone-in ribeye, celebrated for its rich marbling and robust flavor. Seasoned simply with salt and pepper, this steak allows the quality of the beef to shine. The accompanying cowboy compound butter adds depth, introducing smoky and savory notes that elevate the overall taste.</p>
    <p>Preparation involves grilling the steak to the desired doneness, ensuring a flavorful crust while maintaining a juicy interior. Once cooked, a generous dollop of the cowboy butter is applied, melting over the steak to enhance its succulence. This combination makes the Cowboy Steak a satisfying choice for those seeking a classic yet indulgent meal.</p>

    <h3>Cowboy Steak</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (2 1/2-inch-thick) beef cowboy steak (bone-in ribeye), 2 1/2- to 2 3/4-pounds</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>For compound butter, combine butter, parsley, mustard, rosemary, smoked paprika, garlic, and cayenne pepper in a small bowl. Spoon onto a sheet of waxed paper. Roll into a log. Wrap in the waxed paper. Chill in the refrigerator until firm, 30 minutes or up to 1 week.</li>
      <li>For steak, let steak stand at room temperature for 45 minutes.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place a wire rack in a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet.</li>
      <li>Heat oil in a 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high until it starts to smoke. Season steak generously with salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>Sear steak in the skillet until well-browned, 5 minutes per side, then 2 minutes on the fat cap side. Place steak on the rack in the prepared baking sheet.</li>
      <li>Roast 45 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers 135 degrees F (57 degrees C) for medium rare, or 150 degrees F (65 degrees C) for medium.</li>
      <li>Place steak on a cutting board. Tent loosely with foil. Let rest 10 minutes. Temperature will continue to rise as steak rests.</li>
      <li>Slice between meat and bone to separate. Thinly slice steak across the grain. Top sliced steak with Cowboy Compound Butter.</li>
